# Acumos Deployment Client

This repository holds components and tools supporting deployment of Acumos
machine learning models ("solutions") under kubernetes, using CI/CD
infrastructure components based upon Camunda and Jenkins. The Deployment Client
handles the interface between Camunda and Jenkins, processing solution
deployment requests from Camunda, and using Jenkins as the execution engine for
the deployment.

This repo is maintained by the Deployment project under the Acumos AI open
source project. The wiki home for the Deployment project is
https://wiki.acumos.org/display/DEP.

Please see the documentation in the "docs" folder.
